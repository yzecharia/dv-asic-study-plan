# Week 15 — Homework

The canonical homework list lives at
[`docs/week_15.md`](../docs/week_15.md). When you start
the week, port the **Drills**, **Main HWs**, and **Stretch** sections
here — but with explicit file paths, acceptance criteria, and run
commands using the `homework/` folder structure that already exists
in this repo.

## Per-chapter drills (TODO)

> Table: chapter → file path → 3-line spec → acceptance criteria.

## Connector exercise (TODO)

> Tie design + verif. Same DUT, both sides.

## Big-picture exercise (TODO)

> Mini-project within this week's scope only.

## Self-check questions (TODO)

> 5–8 questions answerable without looking. Answer keys at the
> bottom of this file once written.

## Run commands

```bash
cd week_15_*

# Native arm64 sim (Phase 1/2 default)
verilator --lint-only -Wall <rtl_file>.sv
iverilog -g2012 -o /tmp/sim <tb_file>.sv && vvp /tmp/sim

# UVM (Phase 3, when needed)
bash ../run_xsim.sh -L uvm <files>

# Yosys schematic
bash ../run_yosys_rtl.sh <rtl_file>.sv
```
